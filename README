Server is handling multiple clients simulteneously by 
spawning a child using fork() API and listens after 
accepting a client connection.

Server will serve multiple clients once and then close 
the client socket connection.

Test: 
telnet nunki.usc.edu 22095
>>Connected to server

Execute: client time in another terminal, server handles 
this request and closes connection.
